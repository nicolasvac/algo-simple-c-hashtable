# Simple C HashTable implementation

This repository contains a small implementation of a HashTable in C.

It has a debug mode to get a better understanding of what is happening inside the functions.

The `main.c` file contains an example on how to use it.

All the implementations are in `hash_table.h` and `hash_table.c`.

Goals:

- Create a h_index function that can calculate a value from a user key in a constant manner
- Get value method
- Insert value method
- Print hash table method

Non goals:

- Implement a fully fledged HashTable
